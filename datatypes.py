# Datatypes

#The types of data used in python programs.
#Python don't need explicit declaration of datatype hence it is a dynamically typed programming language.

a = 10
print(type(a))

A = 'My names is Napoleon'
print(type(A))

b = 3.1432
print(type(b))


#Types of data :
print('int,float,complex,bool,str,list,tuple,set,frozenset,dict,bytes,none,bytearray,range')

#to know the type, id and value of a variable we use the following inbuilt functions:

print(type(b))
print(id(b))
print(b)
